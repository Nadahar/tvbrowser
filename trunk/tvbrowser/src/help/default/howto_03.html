<h1>Copying the TV data to another computer</h1>
<p>
To copy the TV data to another computer follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
Choose <em>Export</em> from the <em>TV data</em> menu and enter the name and location of the file that will contain the TV data.
</p>
<p>
Copy this file to the target computer. Start <em>TV-Browser</em> there and activate <em>Import</em> from the <em>TV data</em> menu. Choose the previously exported file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hint:</b>
You can only export data residing on the source machine.<br>
If the target computer has subscribed to more channels than the source computer data will be missing because the source computer never downloaded it.
