StatCvs v0.1.3 Users Guide
===========================

Prerequisities
--------------
* JRE 1.4


Installation
------------
* Download latest release from http://statcvs.sf.net.
* Expand statcvs.zip into some directory.
* Check out the desired CVS repository into some directory, e.g. c:\myproject.
* Change into that directory and type 'cvs log > cvslog'.


Usage
-----
StatCvs requires three parameters in order to start its analysis: 

1. a project name,
2. a CVS logfile,
3. the checked out version according to that logfile.

Just call StatCvs with that three parameters, e.g.

   java -jar statcvs.jar MyProject c:\myproject\cvslog c:\myproject
   
will generate the HTML Suite for MyProject into the current directory. 

For additional command line options, call:

   java -jar statcvs.jar


Ant Task
--------
StatCvs comes with an Ant task for the Apache Ant build tool. An example
build file follows:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="StatCvsAnt" default="main" basedir=".">
  <taskdef name="statcvs" classname="net.sf.statcvs.ant.StatCvsTask"/>

  <target name="main">
    <statcvs 
        projectName="StatCvs"
        projectDirectory="d:/statcvs"
        cvsLogFile="d:/statcvs/cvs.log"
        outputDirectory="d:/statcvs/stas"
        cssFile="http://statcvs.sf.net/stats/statcvs.css"
        showCredits="yes"/>
  </target>
</project>

The attributes projectName, projectDirectory and cvsLogFile are required. The
other attributes are optional.


The statcvs.jar file must be on the classpath.


Limitations
-----------
* StatCvs analyzes only the default branch of a repository. Analyzing side
  branches is currently not supported.

* Lines of Code counts will be inaccurate for deleted or moved files.
  StatCvs will try to calculate a minimum line count for files that
  are no longer present in the repository. This number can be much
  smaller than the actual lines of code in the deleted file.

  We can't do much about this right now. StatCvs would need access
  to the cvs server to get accurate numbers.

* If you update your checked out repository using the "prune empty
  directories" switch of CVS ("cvs update -P"), files in deleted
  directories will not be visible to StatCvs.

* Logfiles created with the -d option (specify date range) will not
  work as expected. Currently, there is no way to limit StatCvs output
  to a date range.
