The TV data.

The XML format used here is XMLTV. See http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/

Don't be shocked of the big example programme tag. Most of the nested tags are
not required.

Since the channel information is read from the file TvChannels.xml you don't
have to add channel tags in this file. Present channel tags will be ignored
by the XmlTvPDS.

WARNING: In the example programme tag are some tags defined that contain
information that are supported by TV-Browser but have no equivalence in XMLTV.
Those tags are marked with a "(TV-Browser only)" in the description. If you use
those tags the file will not be valid according to the XMLTV-DTD any more. Since
all these tags are not required you don't have to use them.

    <!-- 'Star rating' - many listings guides award a programme a score as
    a quick guide to how good it is.  The value of this element should be
    'N / M', for example one star out of a possible five stars would be
    '1 / 5'.  Zero stars is also a possible score (and not the same as
    'unrated').  You should try to map whatever wacky system your listings
    source uses to a number of stars: so for example if they have thumbs
    up, thumbs sideways and thumbs down, you could map that to two, one or
    zero stars out of two.  If a programme is marked as recommended in a
    listings guide you could map this to '1 / 1'. Because there could be many
    ways to provide star-ratings or recommendations for a programme, you can
    specify multiple star-ratings. You can specify the star-rating system
    used, or the provider of the recommendation, with the system attribute.
    Whitespace between the numbers and slash is ignored.

    <!-- New.  This is the first screened programme from a new show that
    has never been shown on television before - if not worldwide then at
    least never before in this country.  After the first episode or
    programme has been shown, subsequent ones are no longer 'new'.
    Similarly the second series of an established programme is not 'new'.

    Note that this does not mean 'new season' or 'new episode' of an
    existing show.  You can express part of that using the episode-num
    stuff.
