<p>
This document is a step-by-step tutorial for providing tv listings with our tools.<br />
I've already written a <a href="http://www.tvbrowser.org/international.php">pdf document</a> that you can download from our web site. However, many people thought it was too complicated and used too many technical terms, so I attempted to write a longer version that is easier to understand - this document.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> Before you provide tv listings to the public you must get explicit permission to do so from the rightful owners of the listings!
</p>

<p>
The tutorial consists of several parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="part1_en.html">Part I</a> presents the TV-Browser tools and their use. If you own webspace you may upload your tv listings using ftp. TV-Browser will be able to download them from the webspace.
</li>
<li>
<a href="part2_en.html">Part II</a> explains how you can use our tools to import and publish listings that come inthe Excel file format.
</li>
<li>
<a href="part3_en.html">Part III</a> shows how you can import listings from xml files and use them in TV-Browser. This part is aimed at those who know how to program, but do not know Java. In this case, the xml file serves as a go-between between the data collector you have developed and the TV-Browser tools.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The tutorial requires no programming skills whatsoever. All the tools contained in the downloadable version of the tutorial.
